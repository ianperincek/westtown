        If you're a small business owner in need of an affordable, custom
        website, our team is here to help. With years of experience designing
        web pages that are both visually appealing and functional, we specialize
        in creating solutions that meet your unique business needs.

      <p class="affordable-section__text">
        I’ve worked with some of the <strong
          >largest corporations in the U.S.</strong
        >, and now, I’m offering my services to businesses of all sizes,
        starting at just <strong>$175 a month</strong> for a standard 5 page small
        business website. If you need more than that then we'll scope a custom price
        based on the scope of work.
      </p>
      <p class="affordable-section__text">
        When it comes to web design, the process shouldn’t be complicated or
        unclear. I pride myself on offering personal attention and a
        straightforward, honest approach. You deserve to know exactly what
        you're getting.
      </p>
      <h3 class="affordable-section__heading">Why Are You Here?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you’re reading this, there’s a good chance you’re either: Not
          satisfied with your current website’s look and feel, or
        </li>
        <li>Looking to build a new one but not sure where to begin.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        That’s where I come in. Every day, I work with clients who feel the same
        way—and together, we create websites that are not only visually
        impressive but also <strong>functional</strong> and <strong
          >tailored</strong
        > to their needs.
      </p>

      <h3 class="affordable-section__heading">Let the Work Speak for Itself</h3>
      <p class="affordable-section__text">
        I believe in <strong>letting the results do the talking</strong>. No
        need for over-the-top claims or unnecessary hype. Take a look at my
        portfolio and see real-time examples of what I’ve built. If the work
        resonates with you, I’d be happy to create something exceptional for
        your business too.
